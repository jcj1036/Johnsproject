System Specification:
Your breathing rate monitor must detect if the breathing rate is greater than 40 breaths
per minute and sound an audible warning. If the breathing rate is normal (12-39 breaths
per minute), do not sound a warning. If the breathing rate is well below normal (0 to <10
breaths per minute), this might indicate that the sensor is disconnected, in which case a
warning should be sounded. The warning signal for a disconnected sensor, should be
different than the signal for below normal breathing rate and the high breathing rate
warning. The monitor should operate continuously and reliably. The warning should be
sounded within 2 minutes of the breathing rate entering into either warning zone. The
monitor should not produce either false positives or false negatives.
